## Title
AppSniffer: Towards Robust Mobile App Fingerprinting Against VPN

## Overview
AppSniffer aims to precisely identify mobile apps when a VPN or a proxy is used to hide their identities. That is, AppSniffer recognizes apps with a high accuracy using their network traffic regardless of whether it is being sent over a VPN or not.

## Datasets
We upload datasets to check the performance of AppSniffer. 

## See Quick Example Results
Quick Sample results (NordVPN CV1) are shown in the following file.
